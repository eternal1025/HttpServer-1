# HttpServer
HTTP server that serves static webpages. Meant as a learning exercise.

## Usage
* Clone the repository and `cd` to it
* Run `./server.py [PORT] [BASE_DIR]` where `[PORT]` is the port you want to listen on and `[BASE_DIR]` is the directory path the server looks for requested resources. `[BASE_DIR]` by default is this repo.
* Use any web browser to test it.

## Features
* Supports `GET` and `HEAD` requests
